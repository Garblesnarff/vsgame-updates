# README.md File Template for Project Directories

Every directory in the project should have a README.md file that explains its purpose, contents, and usage. Please follow this template when creating or updating README.md files:

## [Directory Name] Directory

This directory contains [brief description of what the directory contains and its purpose].

### Files

- [filename].[extension]: [Brief description of what the file does and its purpose], [include main functions or components if applicable].
- [additional files as needed]

### Subdirectories

- [subdirectory name]: [Brief description of the subdirectory's purpose], see [subdirectory path]/README.md for details.
- [additional subdirectories as needed]

### Instructions

- [Any specific instructions for working with files in this directory]
- [Development workflows, testing procedures, etc.]

### Dependencies

- [List key dependencies or technologies used in this directory]
- [Note any version requirements]

### Notes

- [Important considerations or caveats for developers]
- [Design decisions, best practices, etc.]

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Create README.md files in every directory, including subdirectories.
2. Use the template above, adapting sections as needed for each directory.
3. Be specific about file purposes and their relationships to other components.
4. Include all major files, but group similar utilities if there are many.
5. For component directories, mention props and usage examples when relevant.
6. Keep README.md files up to date when adding new files or changing directory structure.
7. Use relative links when referencing other files or directories.
